# ðŸ“„ Virtual Interior Designer 

## ðŸ§¾ Project Overview
This repository contains the **software documentation and UML design** for the proposed system **"Virtual Interior Designer"**, an AI-powered platform concept intended to assist users in redesigning their living spaces through intelligent image analysis and design recommendations.

The project was created as part of the **Software Construction and Development** course. It focuses entirely on **requirements analysis, system modeling**, and **technical documentation**â€”no development or implementation was performed.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective
To document and design the structure of an AI-powered interior design application, covering:
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Actor analysis and system scope
- UML diagrams including **Use Case**, **Class**, and **Sequence diagrams**
- Comparative analysis with existing solutions
- Modular system design and feature breakdown

---

## ðŸ“‘ Included Artifacts
- ðŸ“˜ **Module 1 PDF** â€“ Project overview, objectives, platform comparison, unique features  
- ðŸ“— **Module 2 PDF** â€“ Use case documentation, actors, requirements checklist, relationships  
- ðŸ“‚ **UML Diagrams** 
  - Use Case Diagram 
  - Class Diagram 
  - Sequence Diagrams
  - (All diagrams created using **Microsoft Visio)

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Scope
While the application idea involves AI and computer vision, this project strictly focuses on the **software documentation**, including:
- Requirement engineering
- Actor and system interaction mapping
- System-level design and feature decomposition
- Modeling relationships between subsystems and features
